This tool finds Pythagorean triangles whose other angles are close to an integer amount of degrees.
Creating an image of the triangle is also supported.
Both of these tasks allow the user to edit multiple variables.
This tool was created for math teachers to use when making exams when they want rounding to not cause problems for students.
